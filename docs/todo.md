# todo:
## short term/now
* git mirrors
* translate all comments since English is better understood/ is the de-facto standard for programmming
* get video output on VR
* 3dof
* openXR API integration
* full Debian / Ubuntu linux integration

## long term:

* 6dof with lighthouse
* vive pro drivers and usb serial behavior analyzed
* steamVR Flatpak integration: Since steam is 32 bit setting it up on 64 bit only linux distros will be harder; believe me, I tried.
* PnP
