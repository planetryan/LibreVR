## what I need for hardware:

* HTC Vive pro 2 (already have)
* 2x SteamVR Lighthouse 1.0 trackers (alrady have as well)
* vive pro controllers, I have them, they are nice but Knucles one is most ergonimic probably,
for development what I have is fine
* usb analyzer/incerceptor to inspect USB serial protocols on whatever SVR/Vive has in their drivers

### for steam frame (theorized I have no idea I have no devkit)

* serial analyzer?
* pcie interface adapter for whatever
* cant think of anything else until I know more

** to be continued
